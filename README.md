# Predicting Suicide Tendency in Twitter Dataset using NLP Classification

This repository contains code and resources for predicting suicide tendency in Twitter data using NLP classification techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify tweets that indicate a potential risk of suicide. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is specifically curated for this task and consists of a large collection of tweets from individuals who have expressed thoughts related to suicide. The dataset is labeled with binary classes: "suicidal" and "non-suicidal". 

## Approach

The classification model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and transform the raw text data into numerical features. Various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers are employed to train the model. The trained model aims to predict the tendency of suicide in tweets with high accuracy and generalizability.

## Contents

- `preprocessing.py`: Code for preprocessing and cleaning the tweet data.
- `train.py`: Code for training the NLP classification model using the preprocessed data.
- `predict.py`: Code for predicting the suicide tendency in new tweets using the trained model.
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset and generating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
2. Preprocess the raw tweet data using `preprocessing.py`.
3. Train the NLP classification model using `train.py`.
4. Predict the suicide tendency in new tweets using `predict.py`.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using `evaluation.ipynb`.
